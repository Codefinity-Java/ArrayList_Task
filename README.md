# Let's Practice!

Your task is to implement a **library management system** in Java. A `Book` class has already been created for you with all the fields, **setters, and getters**. You can familiarize yourself with it in the `Book` class.

Also, a `LibraryDemo` class has been created for you, which tests all the methods from the `Library` class.

Create a class `Library` that represents a collection of books. Use an `ArrayList` to store instances of the `Book` class.

Implement the following methods in the `Library` class:

- `addBook(Book book)`: Adds a book to the library.
- `removeBookById(int id)`: Removes a book from the library based on the unique identifier.
- `findBooksByAuthor(String author)`: Returns a list of books by the specified author.
- `findBooksPublishedAfterYear(int year)`: Returns a list of books published after the specified year.
- `displayAllBooks()`: Displays information about all the books in the library on the screen.

After that, you need to go to the `LibraryDemo` class and run it. It will **test the correctness of the methods** you implemented.
